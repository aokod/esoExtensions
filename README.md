# esoExtensions
This repository is for extensions to the eso forum software. This includes language packs, skins, and plugins. This repository is meant as a place where one can download just about every known extension, without having to hunt down every single one seperately.
Disclaimer: Not all of these files were created by me. Unless it's written otherwise in the file, I didn't create it.
